# Portable JUnit GUI

This small side project is intended to allow a developer to package Java Selenium tests, written within the JUnit framework, into a simple executable which may be distributed to customers for verification.

I was inspired to try this out myself since it seems to be a generally unanswered question on the internet (see [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/22554820/4639640)). A chief source of aid was [a Baeldung post](https://www.baeldung.com/junit-tests-run-programmatically-from-java) and [an Oracle example](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/components/tree.html).
